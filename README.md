# Spinning Wheelchairs
+ Make sure your corridor is accessible! We offer a simple tool to help calculate accessibility for an electric-powered wheelchair with rear-wheel drive and direct steering. This tool will measure the comfortable distance needed for this type of wheelchair to make a turn from a doorway into a hallway at a constant angle. It will also tell a comfortable doorframe width for this type of chair to pass through.

## UX

### User Stories

+ As a user, I would like to be able to …

1. Add my wheelchair's measures in centimetres;
2. Get the minimum corridor and door width that fits my wheelchair; 
3. Get my results in centimetres and imperial. 

+ As a site owner, I want…

1.  the information to be clear and informative;
2.  the website be easy to navigate;
3.  provide results in metric and imperial for the user;
3.  the information could help to design accessible wheelchair corridors;

### Wireframes 

Wireframes created with Balsamiq. The project was developed from initial wireframes and some modifications were made during the development process to assure better usability.

   + Minimum circle diameter required to do a 360-degree turn;
   + Minimum distance required to do a 90-degree turn;
   + Minimum comfortable width of a hallway to do a turn into from a doorway;
   + Minimum comfortable width of a door frame to pass through.

2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
