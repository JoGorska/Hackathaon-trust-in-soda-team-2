# Spinning Wheelchairs
+ Make sure your corridor is accessible! We offer a simple tool to help calculate accessibility for an electric powered wheelchair with rear wheel drive and direct steering. This tool will measure a comfortable distance needed for this type of wheel chair to make a turn from a doorway into a hallway at a constant angle. It will also tell a comfortable doorframe width for this type chair to pass through.

## UX

### User Stories

+ As a user, I would like to be able to …

1. Add my wheelchair's measures in centimeters;
2. Get the minimum corridor and door width that fits my wheelchair. 
3. Get my results in in centimeters and imperial. 

+ As a site owner, I want…

1.	the information to be clear and informative.
2.	the website be easy to navigate.
3.	the information could help to design accessible wheelchair corridors.

### Wireframes 

Wireframes created with Balsamiq. The project was developed from initial wireframes and some modifications were made during the development process to assure better usability.

## Future Features 

1. Add drop down box containing different wheelchair brands and types that would fill in the form with all necesary data for the known popular wheelchairs
2. Add drop down box to enable different calculations for wheelchairs with different turn - front wheels turning or rear wheels turning or differential steering
3. Analysing door opening - back - front ways or sliding door, which would be most suitable
4. Calculations for coridor width enabling 3 point turn
5. Enable user to choose input imperial or metric measures
6. Analysing small spaces - like bathrooms to make sure there is enough space for wheelchair and opening the door.
